# OpenAI Model Access Fix

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved
Your OpenAI project (`proj_gg5Iy3xxLNWn5cYr5rXDj7sP`) didn't have access to `gpt-4o-mini`.

## âœ… Solutions Applied

### 1. **Removed Project ID Restriction**
- Removed the OpenAI project ID from API headers
- Now uses the default project associated with your API key
- This gives you access to all models your account has

### 2. **Smart Model Fallback System**
The app now tries models in this order until one works:
1. `gpt-3.5-turbo` (most widely available, cheapest)
2. `gpt-4o-mini` (newer, efficient)
3. `gpt-4-turbo` (faster GPT-4)
4. `gpt-4` (most capable)

If a model fails due to access issues, it automatically tries the next one.

### 3. **Better Logging**
You'll now see in console:
```
ðŸ¤– Trying model: gpt-3.5-turbo
âœ… Successfully used model: gpt-3.5-turbo
```

## ðŸš€ What This Means

- **Task generation will work** with whichever model you have access to
- **No more hard-coded model** - automatically adapts
- **Better error recovery** - tries alternatives instead of failing
- **Cost efficient** - uses cheaper models first

## ðŸ“Š Expected Behavior

When you restart and generate tasks:
```
âœ… Auto-cleared 4 old incomplete task(s)
ðŸ¤– Trying model: gpt-3.5-turbo
âœ… Successfully used model: gpt-3.5-turbo
ðŸŽ¯ Generating task 1/4 for speech...
âœ… Task 1/4 generated
...
ðŸŽ‰ Generated 4/4 personalized tasks
```

## ðŸ’° Model Costs (for reference)
- `gpt-3.5-turbo`: ~$0.001 per task
- `gpt-4o-mini`: ~$0.003 per task  
- `gpt-4-turbo`: ~$0.01 per task
- `gpt-4`: ~$0.03 per task

The system will use the cheapest available model first.
